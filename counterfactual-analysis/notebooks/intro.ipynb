    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents a benchmark of machine learning models on multiple\n",
    "tabular datasets, with a focus on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)\n",
    "and counterfactual explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is conducted on three commonly used datasets:\n",
    "Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Adult Income, and Heart Disease.\n",
    "For each dataset, several classifiers are evaluated, and the best-performing\n",
    "model is further analyzed using explainability techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "Three tabular datasets are considered, each representing a binary\n",
    "classification task. The datasets include numerical features and,\n",
    "where applicable, categorical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "The following classifiers are trained for each dataset:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance is evaluated using accuracy on a held-out test set.\n",
    "The best-performing model is selected for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explainability Methods\n",
    "Model decisions are analyzed using:\n",
    "- Feature importance (for tree-based models)\n",
    "- SHAP for global and local explanations\n",
    "- LIME for local explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provide complementary perspectives on model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counterfactual Explanations\n",
    "Counterfactual explanations are generated using the DiCE framework.\n",
    "For selected test instances, minimal changes to input features are identified\n",
    "that lead to a different model prediction, enabling actionable and\n",
    "human-understandable insights."
